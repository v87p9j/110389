Gwyn Paltrow works as a beauty consultant for Zoop Ltd and receives an annual salary of $75,000 p.a. She is currently in a long-term relationship with Chris Marty, and they have plans to get married in the near future. Gwyn owns 70% of Zoop Ltd and the other 30% is owned by the Marty Family Trust. The trustees of the Marty Family Trust are Chris, his brother Steven and their solicitor Kevin, and the benefi ciaries are Chris and his three children from a previous marriage. The Marty Family Trust has not distributed any benefi ciary income for more than four years, including the current year.
Zoop Ltd owns a Rimu writing table which cost $1000 and could be sold to the public for $1,500. However, instead of selling it, the company decided to gift the table to Gwyn’s sister. Zoop Ltd also recently provided an interest-free loan of $200,000 to the Marty Family Trust.
During a trip to Amsterdam to attend a beauty makeup course, Gwyn visited a diamond factory and became captivated by the diamonds. Consequently, she invested in some diamonds and upon her return to New Zealand, her close friend Pascoe Hunt who is a jeweller, expressed interest in buying the diamonds from her. Gwyn has now decided to sell the diamonds to Pascoe. As they met at a café to discuss their respective businesses, Pascoe also suggested that Gwyn consider using a look-through company for her beauty business.
